Raven featured an 8kW ultra-high efficiency motor,\r\n              1.2kW solar array, and LiFePO4 battery. The three-wheeled solar car was constructed from a chromoly steel\r\n              chassis and double wishbone suspension. Raven was the team’s first attempt at tackling modern sustainable\r\n              energy solutions, while setting a framework for future generations of Solar.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n        </transition>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  export default {\r\n    data() {\r\n      return {\r\n        currentCard: 1,\r\n        total: 2,\r\n        cars: ['Raven', 'DayBreak']\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    methods: {\r\n      previousCard() {\r\n        if (this.currentCard - 1 >= 1) {\r\n          this.currentCard--;\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n\r\n      nextCard() {\r\n        if (this.currentCard + 1 <= this.total) {\r\n          this.currentCard++;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n\r\n     created: function () {\r\n      document.querySelector('#app').style.height = '200%';\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n  .vehicles-container {\r\n    width: 100vw;\r\n    height: 100vh;\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: column;\r\n    color: #2c3e50;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .all-cars {\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* Carousel */\r\n  .carousle {\r\n    /* position: relative; */\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: column;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  img {\r\n    border: none; /* Get rid of the default ugly border lines. */\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .pic-container {\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    height: 40vh;\r\n    position: relative;\r\n    /* top: 90vh; */\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: row;\r\n    align-items: center;\r\n    justify-content: space-evenly;\r\n    perspective: 1000px;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .card {\r\n    width: 500px;\r\n    height: 350px;\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    top: 0;\r\n    z-index: -100;\r\n    transition: transform ease-in-out .3s, opacity ease-in-out .3s;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .carousel-control {\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    top: 350px;\r\n    /* margin: 50px 0; */\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: row;\r\n    justify-content: center;\r\n    align-items: center;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .car-pic {\r\n    margin-top: 70px;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .card.mid {\r\n    transform: translateX(0) rotateY(0deg);\r\n    opacity: 1;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .card.left {\r\n    transform: translateX(-50%) rotateY(60deg);\r\n    opacity: 0;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .card.right {\r\n    transform: translateX(50%) rotateY(-60deg);\r\n    opacity: 0;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* Car Info */\r\n  .car-info-container {\r\n    margin-top: 200px;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .project-info{\r\n    padding: 0 7vw;\r\n    line-height: 2;\r\n    font-size: 1.5rem;\r\n    margin-top: 12vh;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* Arrow Icon */\r\n  .previous,\r\n  .next {\r\n    height: 25px;\r\n    width: 25px;\r\n    margin: 0 15vw;\r\n    transition-duration: .3s;\r\n    -moz-transition-duration: .3s;\r\n    cursor: pointer;\r\n    /* position: absolute; */\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .next {\r\n    transform: rotateY(180deg);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .next:hover {\r\n    transform: rotateY(180deg) scale(1.2);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .previous:hover {\r\n    transform: scale(1.2);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @media screen and (max-width: 800px) {\r\n    .all-cars {\r\n      /* position: absolute;\r\n      top: 0;\r\n      height: 35vh;\r\n      width: 100%;\r\n      margin-bottom: 8vh; */\r\n      display: none;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .pic-container {\r\n      align-items: center;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .car-pic {\r\n      transform: scale(0.7);\r\n      /* margin-top: 150px; */\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .next,\r\n    .previous {\r\n      margin: 0 50px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .car-info-container {\r\n      margin-top: 4vh;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/Vehicles.vue","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"arrow.png?f9750f95d43127e64f6064d565b71c13\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/assets/vehicles/arrow.png\n// module id = 8\n// module chunks = 0","<template>\r\n  <div class=\"contact-container\">\r\n    <h1>CONTACT US</h1>\r\n    <h2>Thank you for your interst in UBC Solar!

The team performs in-depth analysis/FEA on all designs to ensure vehicle safety and strong race\r\n      performance. Projects include 3D modeling, optimization, and analysis of the vehicle’s on-road mechanics and\r\n      dynamics. Most components are manufactured in house, providing a strong hands-on experience while also emphasizing\r\n      the necessities of strong mechanical theory and manufacturability.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  export default {\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n  .member-info {\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: column;\r\n    align-items: center;\r\n    justify-content: space-evenly;\r\n    margin: 2vh 9vw;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .member-pics {\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: row;\r\n    justify-content: space-evenly;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .member-pic {\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: column;\r\n    justify-content: center;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .subteam-info {\r\n    padding: 0 7vw;\r\n    line-height: 2;\r\n    font-size: 1.3rem;\r\n    color: #2c3e50;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  h2 {\r\n    margin: 3px;\r\n    color: #2c3e50;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @media screen and (max-width: 700px) {\r\n    .member-info {\r\n      flex-direction: column;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .subteam-info {\r\n      padding: 0 10vw;\r\n      margin-top: 4vh;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .member-pics {\r\n      flex-direction: column;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .member-pic {\r\n      transform: scale(.7, 1);\r\n      margin-top: 4vh;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/Team/mech/Suspension.vue","//jshint esversion:6\n\nimport Vue from 'vue';\nimport App from './App.vue';\n// import VueResource from 'vue-resource';\n\nimport {routes} from './routes.js';\nimport VueRouter from 'vue-router';\n\nVue.use(VueRouter);\n\nconst router = new VueRouter({\n    routes:routes,\n    mode:'history'\n  });\n  \n  new Vue({\n    el: '#app',\n    router:router,\n    render: h => h(App),\n    // created: function() {\n    //   let route = localStorage.getItem('page') || '';\n    //   router.push({name: route});\n    // }\n  });\n\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/main.js","/*!\n * Vue.js v2.6.11\n * (c) 2014-2019 Evan You\n * Released under the MIT License.\n */\n/*  */\n\nvar emptyObject = Object.freeze({});\n\n// These helpers produce better VM code in JS engines due to their\n// explicitness and function inlining.\nfunction isUndef (v) {\n  return v === undefined || v === null\n}\n\nfunction isDef (v) {\n  return v !== undefined && v !== null\n}\n\nfunction isTrue (v) {\n  return v === true\n}\n\nfunction isFalse (v) {\n  return v === false\n}\n\n/**\n * Check if value is primitive.\n */\nfunction isPrimitive (value) {\n  return (\n    typeof value === 'string' ||\n    typeof value === 'number' ||\n    // $flow-disable-line\n    typeof value === 'symbol' ||\n    typeof value === 'boolean'\n  )\n}\n\n/**\n * Quick object check - this is primarily used to tell\n * Objects from primitive values when we know the value\n * is a JSON-compliant type.\n */\nfunction isObject (obj) {\n  return obj !== null && typeof obj === 'object'\n}\n\n/**\n * Get the raw type string of a value, e.g., [object Object].\n */\nvar _toString = Object.prototype.toString;\n\nfunction toRawType (value) {\n  return _toString.call(value).slice(8, -1)\n}\n\n/**\n * Strict object type check.
